# Notes/recommendations
  - import React from 'react' is no longer needed in any file- it's globally imported
  - I like the comments, though don't overdo it- In some places a better variable name is plenty enough
  - A couple of extensions that could be worth trying: 
    - Prettier - this has to do with code formatting. I personally don't use it because I disagree with some of the things it does, but it can be super useful to help learning code consistancy as well as keeping things pretty!
    - Better comments- this unlocks colored comments which are helpful. For example, if you have a comment starting with TODO:, it will highlight the comment in orange
